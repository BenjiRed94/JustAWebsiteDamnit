			<h1>Making websites isn't hard...</h1>
			<h3><em>...you're just making it that way</em></h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<h4>Structure your bloody content</h4>
			<p>HTML <sup>HyperText Markup Language </sup>is a simple, easy to understand language used to make whatever information you want appear on the screen in front of you. <strong>Don't overcomplicate it</strong><br>
			Whether you're some kind of <strong>HTML guru</strong> or a <em>complete beginner</em>, your main focus with HTML should be structuring the <strong>content</strong> in a <em>smart, pleasing and easy to use way</em>.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<h4>Have some damn style</h4>
			<p>CSS, <sup>Cascading StyleSheets</sup> like HTML, is a simple to understand language designed to make the information you put on the screen look pretty, <strong>mostly</strong>. A lot of CSS is used to help make the layout of information look more appealing or professional <sub><small>or <em>'flashy'</em></small></sub><br>
			But whether you're structuring a simple page describing your favourite topping for your morning toast and why strawberry jam will always be the superior option, or making a deep, complex, 38,000 page wikia page on every tiny little detail of your favourite game, movie, or book <strong>remember</strong> that CSS should be simple, lightweight and make whatever it is you're looking at <em><strong>easier to use</strong></em>.<br>
			Don't waste resources and time loading up <span class="large">32 fonts</span> so you can use <span class="large">4 letters</span> in your opening logo that <strong>nobody</strong> is going to pay attention to; or bringing in a 4.3MB file of <em>utter garbage</em> 'styling' that makes your <span class="large">dropdown menu</span> have a 'beautiful' <sub><small>tacky</small></sub> hover animation, that your blind, mobile user isn't going to see.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container hide-on-mobile clearfix">
			<h4>Use some damn images</h4>
			<img src="adorablekitten.jpg" alt="An adorable kitten" class="kitten">
			<p class="left">Unless what you're building stictly needs to be text <em>only</em>, then use some images to split up the content, make the page feel <em>alive</em>, like it's had some thought put into it.<br>
			Look at that adorable little thing, it's a beautiful damn cat, it's lovely. It envokes a feeling of warmth inside you, unless you're allergic to cats or hate them for some reason, <span class="large">you monster!</span></p><br><br>
			<small>Credit to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tinasperspective/?hl=en">@tinasperspective</a> for the picture of the cat, Google helped me find it and then find the owner, it's totally adorable!</small>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<h4>Learn to use <code>@media</code> queries</h4>
			<p>While there is certainly a time and place for it (not my problem, that's for you to figure out), you should know that just because it looks amazing on Â£1000 workstation, with it's UHD display and wide color gamut doesn't mean it's going to look that good on grandma's 8 year old iPhone running the OS it shipped with.<br>
			Notice how when you shrink this page down the header size gets smaller too, and (though you should probably never do this) the section above talking about using images magically disappears!</p>

		<h3>Of course this is <em>satire</em></h3>
		<p>This was a tiny project I decided to take on myself to learn more about web design, because I've got no damn idea what I'm really doing or talking about.<br>
		I was inspired by <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this</a>, <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/">this</a>, and <a href="https://thebestmotherfuckingwebsite.co/">this</a> and wanted thought I could do something <strong>similar</strong>.</p>
